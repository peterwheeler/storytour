These would have been demolished in the massive building programme initiated by Trajan, leading to the excavation of the huge Trajanic basin, surrounded by some very large buildings on a scale that invites comparison with Imperial Rome itself."

Perhaps the large ships bringing grain from North Africa and Egypt would have moored commoditiesin the protection of the outer basin, until allocated a slot along the quays that defined the Grandi Magazzini di Traiano and the Portico di Claudio, while those carrying other commdities would have eventually docked in the Trajanic basin. Whilst we cannot be sure how it worked, and lack the crucial written documentation, we do have a sense of the mammoth scale and complexity of the task."

The surviving Terrazza di Traiano was the monumental western-facing colonnaded façade of the Palazzo.<br/><br/>The Palazzo Imperiale was a concrete structure faced with opus mixtum which covered nearly three hectares. Of its original three storeys, only the substructures and some of the first floor remain. The Palazzo‘s trapezoidal plan was dictated by the isthmus of land lying between the two basins on which it was situated.<br/><br/>The structure has been of significant interest since the 16<sup>th</sup> century due to the discoveries of numerous columns, sculptures and inscriptions. The complex also contained its own bath suite in its southwest corner. The corpus of brickstamps found in the building indicates it was a predominantly Trajanic construction with later renovations undertaken by Hadrian and the Antonines. The building’s location as well as the evidence of its lavish marble decoration suggests it was presumably the headquarters of a high-ranking official or potentially the emperor himself.<br/><br/>Within the complex are several building spaces along the northern façade that have been excavated between 2007 and 2015 as part of the Portus Project.<br/><br/><strong>a) Castellum Aquae (Building 1):</strong><br/>This was a three-storey brick-faced cistern block, a castellum aquae, dating to the late Trajanic-Hadrianic period. It forms part of the north-eastern. The north side of the cistern block rested on the pre-Trajanic mole delineating the Claudian basin and on a Trajanic mole to the south.<br/><br/><strong>b) Building 3:</strong><br/>Immediately to the west of the Castellum Aquae was another part of the Palazzo Imperiale, a very long room (Building 3) that in turn abutted a major complex of rooms focused upon a cistern/peristyle (Building 8). In the centre of the former was an open area around which ran a vaulted portico on three stories; the bases of the piers that supported the vaults can still be clearly seen. This room was provided with an opus spicatum (brick herringbone) floor, typical of working or service areas in major buildings such as this. In the early third century, a small glass-producing furnace was installed.<br/><br/>To the south of Buildings 1 and 3 there was an open area that provided access to the eastern facade of the Palazzo Imperiale from the quayside to the east."

It was composed of three building sections, each of which was subdivided by brick-faced concrete piers into a series of parallel passages, narrow bays and wide bays. The building stood to c. 18m high, with its southern side comprising an arched façade that opened onto the Trajanic basin. The arched openings were subsequently filled in with brick and reticulate-faced walls. The width of the narrow bays is c. 12 m.
